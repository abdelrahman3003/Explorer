  "Mars, often referred to as the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system. Here's a brief description of some key features and characteristics of Mars:Appearance: Mars has a distinctive reddish appearance due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface. The planet's surface is also marked by dark regions, light regions, and polar ice caps.Size and Distance: Mars is smaller than Earth, with a diameter of about half that of Earth's. It is the second smallest planet in the solar system, larger only than Mercury. Its distance from the Sun is about 1.5 times that of Earth's.",
  "Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system, orbiting closest to the Sun. Here's a brief description of some key features and characteristics of Mercury:Size and Distance: Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system, with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles). It is located about 57.9 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun, making it the closest planet to our star.Orbit and Rotation: Mercury has the shortest orbital period of all the planets, completing one orbit around the Sun in about 88 Earth days. Its rotation period (day) is longer than its orbital period, taking about 59 Earth days to complete one rotation. This means that Mercury has a unique 'day' and 'night' cycle.",
  "Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system and the only known celestial body to support life. Here's a brief description of some key features and characteristics of Earth:Size and Distance: Earth has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles), making it the fifth largest planet in the solar system. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 149.6 million kilometers (92.9 million miles).Composition: Earth is a rocky planet with a solid surface and a dense, iron-rich core. Its atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), with trace amounts of other gases such as carbon dioxide, argon, and water vapor.",
  "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and the fifth planet from the Sun. Here's a brief description of some key features and characteristics of Jupiter:Size and Mass: Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 139,822 kilometers (86,881 miles), making it more than 11 times wider than Earth. It is also the most massive planet, with a mass over 300 times that of Earth.Composition: Jupiter is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, similar to the composition of the Sun. Its dense atmosphere also contains small amounts of other gases such as methane, ammonia, and water vapor. Jupiter has no solid surface; its outer layers gradually transition into a dense liquid metallic hydrogen layer surrounding a rocky core.",
  "Venus is the second planet from the Sun in our solar system, and it is often referred to as Earth's 'sister planet' due to their similar size and composition. Here's a brief description of some key features and characteristics of Venus:Size and Composition: Venus is similar in size to Earth, with a diameter of about 12,104 kilometers (7,521 miles), making it slightly smaller than Earth. It is composed primarily of rock and metal, with a dense atmosphere that is mostly carbon dioxide (about 96.5%), with small amounts of nitrogen and other gases.Atmosphere: Venus has a thick atmosphere that is about 90 times denser than Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere creates a strong greenhouse effect, trapping heat and making Venus the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures that can reach up to 465°C (869°F). The high temperatures and pressure on Venus's surface make it inhospitable to "
